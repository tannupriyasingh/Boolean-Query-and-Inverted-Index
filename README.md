# Boolean-Query-and-Inverted-Index

Indexed a subset of PubMed Corpus using Apache Solr to generate lucene index.

Developed a java application that would use relevant functions of Lucene API and interact with the Lucene index to construct its own Inverted Index.

Generated posting list of indexed data using term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time strategy.
